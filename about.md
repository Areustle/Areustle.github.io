My name is Alexander Reustle; I go by Alex. This is my personal blog, devoted
to myself and the things which interest me. I'm passionate about people,
places, science, and imagination.

Since 2012 I have worked as a software developer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center where I create digital tools and systems for Fermi, the gamma ray space
telescope. I am fascinated by Artificial Intelligence and High Performance
Computing; both of which I study in my Computer Science Master's program at the
University of Maryland, College Park.

My favorite programming language is C++, followed by Python. My text editor of
choice is VIM. I prefer Linux and MacOS operating systems. I waste my time too
easily. My hobbies and interests focus heavily on expression, creativity and
imagination. I am fan of Science Fiction and Fantasy literature. I love
table-top role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons. I am energized by
society and culture, by government and business, by justice and inequality. I
inconsistently employ the Oxford Comma.

I am devoted to my beautiful wife Holly Reustle. I was born in the suburbs of
Philadelphia. I grew up in America and the United Kingdom. I attended
university in Washington D.C. and currently live in Baltimore Maryland.
